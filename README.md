## Simple Transcriber in Python
### Version 4

Just use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
then run with `python mp3_to_sbv.py audio.mp3`, replacing `audio.mp3` by the path to an `mp3` file.
and it will generate an `audio.sbv` next to the input file.

Why `mp3` to `sbv`? Because that's what [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/) exports when you download subtitles.

Initially vibe-coded with **Qwen**.
